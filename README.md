# Nutri-Goals

## Specifications

This program allows users to create daily meal plans based on their goals, needs, and preferences. Intended to cater 
towards those with particular diets, conditions, and allergies, the user is recommended recipes from a database of 
pre-built meal plans that are applicable to their needs. The user will be able to search for recipes by name and 
general tags. Additionally, the user is able to specify exactly what nutritional information they'd like to track 
based on their individual goals (i.e, calories will not be displayed unless explicitly toggled), intended to be 
accessible towards users of all intents and conditions. Meal plans, recipe information, and tracked nutritional 
information are stored for the user to access as they please.

### A user will set basic personal information when they first create their account:
    1. Username: used to log in to the account
    2. Password: used to log in to the account
    3. Gender: a user's specified gender (can be male and/or female, or other)
    4. Height: the user's height, used to calculate weight goals
    5. Weight: the user's weight, used to calculate various recommended intakes and weight goals
    6. Age: the user's age, used to calculate various recommended intakes based on age-group
    7. Exercise Level: the user's exercise level, measured from not active to very active (1-5)

#### Note: The user will be assigned a unique userID

### A user will further set various preferences after they create their account:
    1. Diet: a user's specified diet (ex: vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian, none)
    2. Allergies: any allergens the user would like to avoid
    3. Conditions: any conditions the user may have that will affect the recipes they would like to be suggested
    4. Tracked Nutrients: the nutritional information the user would like to track (ex: macro/micronutrients)
    5. Weight Goal: a user's specified (or unspecified) weight goal (ex: lose, gain, maintain)

#### Note: The nutrients that the user can choose to track with relation to the meal plans they create:
    a) Macronutrients: calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats
    b) Micronutrients: calcium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin D, iron, magnesium, sugar

### Main Design Decisions
1. CommonUserFactory: 

    By implementing a commonUserFactory which sets default values to User Attributes we were able to separate the 
    construction of the user object based on each use case. To construct a user we would only need to set a userId and 
    username. The userId is how the user accounts are mapped as it is unique to each user. We take in username to 
    ensure that two users do not have the same username. With this it is now possible to easily extend the user entity
    to incorporate more attributes and even implement the builder design pattern for updating the user object.
2. FileCSVBuilder
   
    With the implementation of a new commonUserFactory where we can set default values for the user, we were now able 
    to only ask the user for relevant information based on the use case. For example, in the weight Goal use case step 
now it is possible to only ask the user to input the required data needed for the use case as discussed before, along 
with userId which is how the user accounts are mapped. Now the builder is able to update the csv file based on the input
data from that use case. A user object is created and then we use the flexibility of the commonUserFactory to set these 
updated attributes into the user object. Since this is all mapped by a unique userId, the builder takes this information 
and updates the csv, data storage, accordingly. With this implementation the fileUserDao is essentially only retrieving 
the newly updated data from the csv by the use of loadUserDataFromCsv method. With the implementation of this builder 
design pattern we were able to display a portion of our code which evidently follows the single responsibility principle
and lets us be able to extend the code much more easily in the future. For example, for any future use case where we 
would want to gather more information relevant to the user account, the builder will be able to hand any type of updates 
towards the user object for the current user who is using our application.
   
    
### Proposed Entities
    1. User
        Attributes: UserID, name, password, creationTime, gender, userHeight, weight, age, exerciseLevel
                    diet, trackedNutrients, allergies, conditions, weightGoal, paceType, requiredCalories
    2. Ingredient
        Attributes: ingredientID, name, amount
    3. Recipe
        Attributes: recipeID, recipeName, recipeIngredients, recipeInstructions, recipeType, nutritionalInfo
                    recipeLink
    4. MealPlan
        Attributes: breakfast, lunch, dinner

### User Stories
    1. Alex hears about an app that is able to offer recipes/meal ideas based on the userâ€™s unique goals and 
        preferences. He makes an account using his email and creates a password. After he makes an account, he is met 
        with a list of different goals he can have, which range from iron, calcium, and protein intake as well as 
        specific Vitamin A, B, C intake and so forth(which he can input an amount for if he chooses). He chooses what he
        wants to track, and the goal is added to his account. The app will then recommend daily recipes to meet his 
        daily goals. (Team)
    2. Christine was recently told by her doctor that she is iron deficient. She wants to build meal plans conscious of 
        her deficiency and track her daily and average intakes. She created an account with the food & nutrition 
        management program that keeps track of iron intake. She is shown recipes that are high in iron relative to her 
        goal.
