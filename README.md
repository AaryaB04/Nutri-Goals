# Nutri-Goals

## Specifications

This program allows users to create daily meal plans based on their goals, needs, and preferences. Intended to cater 
towards those with particular diets, conditions, and allergies, the user is recommended recipes from a database of 
pre-built meal plans that are applicable to their needs. The user will be able to search for recipes by name and 
general tags. Additionally, the user is able to specify exactly what nutritional information they'd like to track 
based on their individual goals (i.e, calories will not be displayed unless explicitly toggled), intended to be 
accessible towards users of all intents and conditions. Meal plans and tracked nutritional information is stored for the
user to access as they please.

# A user will set various preferences besides basic personal information when they first create their account:
    1. Diet: a user's specified diet (ex: vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian, none)
    2. Tracked Nutrients: the nutritional information the user would like to track (ex: macro/micronutrients)
    3. Allergies: any allergens the user would like to avoid
    4. Conditions: any conditions the user may have that will affect the recipes they would like to be suggested
    5. Weight Goal: a user's specified (or unspecified) weight goal (ex: lose, gain, maintain)

# Note: The nutrients that the user can choose to track with relation to the meal plans they create:
    a) Macronutrients: calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats
    b) Micronutrients: calcium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin D, iron, magnesium, sugar

## User Stories
    1. Alex hears about an app that is able to offer recipes/meal ideas based on the userâ€™s unique goals and 
        preferences. He makes an account using his email and creates a password. After he makes an account, he is met 
        with a list of different goals he can have, which range from iron, calcium, and protein intake as well as 
        specific Vitamin A, B, C intake and so forth(which he can input an amount for if he chooses). He chooses what he
        wants to track, and the goal is added to his account. The app will then recommend daily recipes to meet his 
        daily goals. (Team)
    2. Christine was recently told by her doctor that she is iron deficient. She wants to build meal plans conscious of 
        her deficiency and track her daily and average intakes. She created an account with the food & nutrition 
        management program that keeps track of iron intake. She is shown recipes that are high in iron relative to her 
        goal.
