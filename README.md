The user could potentially track: calories, carbohydrates, proteins and fats(macronutrients), iron, vitamin B12, magnesium(micronutrients).

User Stories:

Alex hears about an app that is able to offer recipes/meal ideas based on the userâ€™s unique goals and preferences. He makes an account using his email and creates a password. After he makes an account, he is met with a list of different goals he can have, which range from iron, calcium, and protein intake as well as specific Vitamin A, B, C intake and so forth(which he can input an amount for if he chooses). He chooses what he wants to track, and the goal is added to his account. The app will then recommend daily recipes to meet his daily goals. (Team) /n
